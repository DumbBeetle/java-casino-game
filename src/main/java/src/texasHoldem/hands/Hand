Hand value:

No Pair (High Card) = 1 only check highest card value
One Pair (2 2) = 2
Two Pairs (2 2 , 3 3) = 3
Three of a Kind (2 2 2) = 4
Straight (2 3 4 5 6) = 5
Flush (5 cards with the same symbol) = 6
Full House (2 2 2 , 3 3) = 7
Four of a Kind (2 2 2 2) = 8
Straight Flush (2 3 4 5 6 with same symbol) = 9
Royal Straight Flush (10 J Q K A with same symbol) = 10

You always play the best 5 cards ONLY.
In case of pair and above high card check should be on the pair.
In case of pair and above having equal value check highest card that's not related to the pair.

                                         Card Checker

* Cards are added to list as raw data.
  need to get Symbol and Rank from them.

Four lists
1 to hold all of the cards
2 to check Symbols
3 to check Ranks
4 to only holds the best (up to 5) cards


* Four of a kind and Full House can never be flush or straight

* If found flush keep those 5 cards and check them for straight, if also found straight check high card,
  if high card is Ace then return 9 else return 8

* If found straight keep those 5 cards and return 4.
  Else check for pairs.

  If two players have pairs check who has the highest pair.
  If two players or more have the same pair then check who has the highest card of the remaining cards.


  after pair check
  cards will be kept in list without their duplicates and instead a string will keep the count

  before:
  2 3 3 3 7 A A list
  1 3     1 2   string
  after:
  2 3 7 A list
  1 3 1 2 string

  cards will be added to temp list in backwards order from last to first
  if found 4 will look for 1 highest card (not related to the 4)
  if found 3 will look for 2 or 1 1
  if found 2 will look 3 or 2 1 or 1 1 1
  if found 1 will look for 1 1 1 1

  and then back to main list with their duplicates


  Card checker is supposed to return an array with values
  player values, pair 1, pair 2, fifth card.

  Tie:
  Pairs - check highest not pair related card.
  Straight - check highest card.
  Flush - check highest card if tie again check next until tie break or you run out of cards.
  Straight Flush - check highest card.
  Royal Flush - split pot.

  If there's no tie breaker current players split the pot.
